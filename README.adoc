= Spring Security OAuth 2.0 Gateway Exploration Example

This is the full source-code for the https://blog.jdriven.com/2019/10/spring-security-5-2-OAuth-2-exploration-part1/[following blog post series].

_No license is provided as it is only meant for learning purposes._

== Set-up

The basic set-up we are going for is:

* gateway at localhost:8080
* dummy service at localhost:8081
* keycloak at localhost:9090

run `docker-compose up -d` inside the `keycloak` directory to start a local keycloak server mapped to host port `9090`

== One-time Keycloak set-up

Browse to http://localhost:9090

* login with `admin` / `admin`
* create a realm called `service` 
* a client called `gateway`
** use `valid redirect url`: `http://localhost:8080/*`
** select `Access Type`: `confidential`
** `save` and click on the newly visible tab `Credentials`
* Copy the `Secret` to the `client-secret` in the oauth-gateway application.yml
* create a user for yourself to login with
* create a role called `dummy` and assign it to your user

== Running the services

run `GatewayApplication` to start the gateway

run `DummyApplication` to start the dummy backend service

== Manual verification

Browse incognito to http://localhost:8080

* login with the user you created
* checkout the result (in case of a silent 401/403 failure, check for a `WWW-Authenticate` header in the response for a clue)

NOTE: In order to see one of the powers of OAuth-based AuthN/AuthZ, restart the Gateway and/or Dummy service and/or remove you Session Cookie stored in your browser (`F12`, `Application`, `Cookies`, `http://localhost:8080`, `Clear All` in Chrome) and refresh the page.

NOTE: If you just want to look at how the request with the token to the backend looks like, you could also just run _netcat_ instead of the dummy-service using:
`nc -l localhost 8081`
